### Python implementation of Sparse Subspace Clustering algorithm

Sparse Subspace Clustering is a subspace clustering algorithm based on techniques from sparse representation theory.

- See [Sparse Subspace Clustering](http://www.vision.jhu.edu/ssc.htm) for more information.
- This implementation is based on [SSC code for MATLAB (using CVX)](http://www.vision.jhu.edu/code/fetchcode.php?id=3) provided by [JHU Vision Lab](http://www.vision.jhu.edu/code/).
- Requirements - numpy, scipy, sklearn, cvxpy. Tested with Python 3.
- cvxpy python package can be installed from [cvxpy page](https://cvxgrp.github.io/cvxpy/index.html).
- Start exploring with `SSC.py`. `SSC_test()` method in this file provides a basic example of subspace clustering. To run: `python SSC.py`.

Note: A significant effort went into this code. If you decide to use this code, I would really appreciate an email at [garg26@wisc.edu](mailto:garg26@wisc.edu).
